This is a very good question 
it used Array Difference Technique

in this technique instead of O(q*n) time 
we are getting answer in O(1)

we are updating the starting index by +x and the last+1 index by -x 
and then we take the sum of the prefeix by taking the sum of the prefix we 
can change all the values in the given range

MY solution was correct its a naive solution wih the help of teh technique we can achieve very 
efficient solution.
