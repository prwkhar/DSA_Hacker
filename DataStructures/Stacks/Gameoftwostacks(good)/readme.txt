its a good question in this we have to max the sum from both the stack so that 
the number of elements is maximum for that we have greedy approach but by that approach it is not possible
to pass all the test cases
so we have another approach from that by putting all the element of one stack till we reach the max sum
then we iterate the elements from the other stack  and then keep on removing the elements 
fromt the first
